Contributions are welcome. Feel free to submit a pull request. 

If you're not sure about something, open an issue first to discuss it.

To make sure your pull request goes smoothly, please follow these guidelines:
1. Run the tests before submitting your pull request. If you're adding a new feature, add a test for it.
2. Follow the existing code style as much as possible.
3. Make sure your code is formatted with `dotnet format`. The GitHub Action will fail if dotnet format results in any changes.
